What worked for me (used Windows 11). I'm not particularly knowledgeable, so take this all with a grain of salt.:

	Environmental variables setup I used:

BUILD_PACKAGE = C:\Users\"User"\Desktop\ -location shouldn't matter. Files are built to file you build from. This is for standalone zip if you want that.

BUILD_VSPROJ = C:\Users\"User"\Desktop\ -location shouldn't matter. Files are built to file you build from.

JOM_LOC = C:\Qt\Qt5.14.2\Tools\QtCreator\bin\jom.exe -jom.exe location

LLVM_LOC = C:\Program Files\LLMV\bin\ -path to LLVM bin with clang-format.exe

NSIS_LOC = C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\ -path to installation of NSIS with the makensis file

PYTHON_LOC = C:\Users\"User"\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\ -path to python used

QT_LOC = C:\Qt\Qt5.14.2\5.14.2\msvc2017_64\bin -path to Qt bin for msvc2017

VS_LOC = C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat -path to VS vcvarsall.bat

	Environmental variables I added to Path (not sure which are necessary - I tried a lot of things):

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\IDE -to be honest, I can't remember what issue I did this to try to correct, but I kept it.  Unsure if necessary.

C:\Users\"User"\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\ -python location

C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\ -NSIS location

C:\Qt\Qt5.14.2\Tools\mingw730_64\bin -added this at one point when I had errors related to g++. Unsure if this is necessary, but I kept it.

C:\Qt\Qt5.14.2\5.14.2\msvc2017_64\bin -path to Qt bin for msvc2017

C:\Program Files\CMake\bin -path to cmake exe files

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat -path to VS vcvarsall.bat

C:\Qt\Qt5.14.2\Tools\QtCreator\bin\jom.exe -jom.exe location

	How I built/compiled:

Extracted zip file.

Ran build_windows.cmd in windows powershell (RAN POWERSHELL AS ADMIN).

When done, closed powershell.

Opened AdvancedSettings.vcxproj with VS. Updated Windows SDK version to 10.00 and Platform Toolset to v143 on pop-up. Hit okay.

Build>Batch Build -select release, and debug if you want that also, then select build


zip standalone is in \OpenVR-AdvancedSettings-master\bin\win64

exe is in \OpenVR-AdvancedSettings-master\bin\win64\AdvancedSettings
